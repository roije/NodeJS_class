# #5 Exercise: Create a Package.json file

In this exercise you should produce the code in javascript and Node.js, that will create the output you can see in the screencast below.

### Solutions can be found in the branches _[simple](https://github.com/keanodejs/05_exercise_package_json/tree/simple), [full](https://github.com/keanodejs/05_exercise_package_json/tree/full)_ and _[class_example](https://github.com/keanodejs/05_exercise_package_json/tree/class_example)_ ###

(Notice: You can copy/paste from the screencast, if you like).

The application should be able to print to the terminal, and you should be able to pass in informations in the terminal, and it should be able to save the answers in a file on your computer called package.json.

The Package.json file created in the screencast looks like this:

````json
{
    "name": "write_to_file_app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "This is an exercise for the node.js class",
    "entry point": "package.js",
    "author": "clbo",
    "license": "RSC"
}
```

You will have to make use of the following node.js and javascript elements:

* [Understanding asynchronous tasks](https://www.lynda.com/MyPlaylist/Watch/6674592/408266?autoplay=true)   
* [callbacks](https://www.lynda.com/MyPlaylist/Watch/6674592/408266?autoplay=true)
* [stdout](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_stdout)
* [stdin](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_stdin)   
* [process](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/process.html)
* [eventlisteners](https://www.lynda.com/MyPlaylist/Watch/6674592/454433?autoplay=true) 
* [file system](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/fs.html)
* [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp)
* [JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)

So basically create an application that is able to get the answers and save the answers in a package.json file.

Solution files will be added later today.
